I am **Tanjim Bin Faruk**. I'm currently on my final year of styuding Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technlogoy (BUET). I created this blog to organize my writing. I'll be writing about:

- Problem Solving
- Something new that I learned
- Something that has been bugging my mind

Feel free to knock me if you have any questions!

<!-- ### my history -->

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
