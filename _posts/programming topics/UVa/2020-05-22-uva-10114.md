This was an easy problem. But I fell into the trap thinking that, ``down payment = monthly payment``. But The monthly payment is ``loan_payment / number_of_months``. In the first test case, it just happens to be,

\\[ \frac{15000}{300} = 500 = \textrm{Monthly Payment} = \textrm{Down Payment}  \\]

In the second test case, ``Monthly_payment != Down_Payment``. Once this fact is understood, the rest boils down to just simulating the process. Following is my ``C++`` solution:

Another thing to watch out for is the output format. I got a silly ``WA`` by printing $\text{0 month}$, where in the problem statement it was clearly mentioned to output ``months`` in all cases expect $1$.
