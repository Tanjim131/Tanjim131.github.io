This problem made me suffer a little bit! Given two positive integer $n$ and $p$, this problem asks to find a positive integer $k$ such that $k^n = p$, or in other words, $k$ is the positive $n$-th root of $p$.

My initial attempt was to use ***binary search***. We guess on the value of $k$ and check if our guess is correct. As $1 \leq k \leq 10^9$ and $n$ is fixed, as $k$ is increased so does the value of $k^n$ and so the the monotonicity property is fulfilled (Increasing or decreasing $k$ will increase or decrease $k^n$ and so can incrementally close in on the range where the answer lies). The only caveat is checking if our current guess of $k$ value is valid or not. 

Because the value of $p$ can be massive ($p < 10^{101}$), we have to use either ``double`` or ``string`` data type to store $p$. ``string`` operations are expensive, unless the multiplication is done efficiently. ``C++`` has no built in ``BigInteger`` class like ``Java``, and so a naive $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ multiplication will likely exceed the time limit. ``Java`` implements more efficient multiplication algorithms like [Karatsuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm) $\left(\mathcal{O}(n^{1.585})\right)$ or [Toom-Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toom%E2%80%93Cook_multiplication) $\left(\mathcal{O}(n^{1.465})\right)$ from ``Java 1.8`` onwards. The following implementation uses ``BigInteger`` library of ``Java``:

We can write our own ``BigInteger`` class/library in ``C++``, but it wouldn't be very efficient and to come up with something efficient will require significant amount of time and effort. So, let's throw ``string`` out of the picture and focus on ``double``. How is ``double`` represented in ``C++``? See the following picture:

``double`` is in the format $\pm 1.\textrm{mantissa} \times 2^{\textrm{exponent}}$.
